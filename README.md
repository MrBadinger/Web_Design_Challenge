# Web-Design-Challenge

In this challenge we create a multipage website to display matplotlib charts from a previous activity. This project does the following:

1. Includes an index.html file in the root directory that points to the main.html file in the Web Visualizations folder.
2. Includes a navbar that is used in each html file that links to the chart pages, comparison page, and data page.
3. Using jupyter notebook we file we converted the weather data CSV file that was used to generate the charts, and put the data into a table located in the data.html
4. Includes a splash page with the index.html that gives an overview of the project as well as small chart pictures that link to the individual chart pages.
5. Each chart has its own visualization page.
6. Includes a style.css file to apply the appropriate formats including formatting for when the size of the page falls below 900px.
